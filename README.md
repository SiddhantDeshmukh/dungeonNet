# DungeonNet - Making Procedural Dungeons Using Graph Theory

This is my attempt to make procedural dungeons using graph theoretical
principles. Inspired by general graph stuff and games such as Unexplored.

## Features To Implement

### Room class with attributes like size and shape

- Grid of pixels/voxels

### Passages, corridors and doors between rooms

- Generate where door should be and random corridor path

### Dungeon as a graph

- Use spring-based physics sim to jumble and settle the rooms

### Multi-level dungeons

### Analysing connectivity, different kinds of doorways / entrances

### Scalable complexity of generation

### Populate dungeon with themed inhabitants

### Time-dependent evolution of dungeon and its inhabitants

### Visualisation tool to map graph to tiles

### Cyclic Dungeon
